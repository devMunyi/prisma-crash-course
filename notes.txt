Setting up NextJs with Prisma
1) Initialize NextJs Project: 
npx create-next-app@latest or npx create-next-app@<specific_version>

2) Setting Up Prisma 
2.1) Install Prisma Dev Dependency
npm i -D prisma 

2.2) Install Project Dependency
npm i @prisma/client

2.3) Initialize Prisma 
npx prisma init

Data Model
1) Introspection: 
- Allow use prisma with an existing database and tables
- Then run the following command to create models with existing schema
    npx prisma db pull

2) Migration 
- No exixting tables 
- We define models ourselves then run migrations
- Tables are then created based on the defined models

NOTE: In defining model we use prisma types and not typescript types
- Types in prisma are capitalized e.g Int, String, Boolean, Float etc
- We use single @ when we are modifying behavior of a field/column
- We use double @@ when we are modifying behavior of a model 
- map attribute is used to change/specify name to be used in the 
database if it should be different from one defined on prisma model
- We can use prisma studio to manage model instead of adminer by
running:
    npx prisma studio
- Running above command spins up prisma studio localhost port 5555 hence 
you can access the interface on the broweser


Relationships
1) One to one
2) One to Many
3) Many to Many
- For this one prisma support explict and implict
a) explicit => you create a joint/pivot table between the two tables 
b) implicit => you don't need to create joint table. Prism automatically 
create one for us and no need to use @relation attribute to 
mape the two tables
